## Project: ClipKeep - Smart Clipboard Manager

Built a clipboard history manager that auto-categorizes copied content.

### What it does:
- Monitors clipboard in background daemon mode
- Auto-categorizes: URLs, emails, phone numbers, IP addresses, hex colors, code snippets, addresses, plain text
- SQLite storage with full-text search
- CLI interface for search, browse, and management

### Tech stack:
- Node.js + clipboardy + better-sqlite3 + commander
- SQLite FTS5 for fast search
- Pattern matching + heuristics for categorization

### Commands:
- `clipkeep daemon` - Start monitoring
- `clipkeep search <query>` - Search history
- `clipkeep recent` - Show recent items
- `clipkeep categories` - List categories
- `clipkeep clean --days 30` - Remove old items

### Status:
- Core functionality working
- All categorization tests passing
- Database schema with FTS search ready

### Location:
`/root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/clipkeep/`

### Next steps (if continued):
- Add TUI browser mode (using ink or blessed)
- Hotkey integration for instant paste
- Export/import functionality
- Configurable retention policies
- Duplicate detection

## Project: FileSage - Natural Language File Search

Built a local semantic search tool for files using embeddings.

### What it does:
- Indexes files and generates embeddings using local ML model (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Search with natural language: "that Python script about PDF parsing"
- No cloud, no API keys — runs entirely locally
- Combines vector similarity + full-text search fallback

### Tech stack:
- Node.js + @xenova/transformers for local embeddings
- better-sqlite3 for storage
- Cosine similarity for vector search
- FTS5 for text fallback

### Commands:
- `filesage index <directory>` - Index a directory
- `filesage search "query"` - Natural language search
- `filesage status` - Show indexing stats
- `filesage remove <directory>` - Remove from index

### Status:
- Core indexing working
- Semantic search functional
- Tested on clipkeep project — correctly identifies relevant files

### Location:
`/root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/filesage/`

### Next steps:
- Watch mode for auto-reindexing changed files
- Incremental updates (only changed files)
- GUI/TUI for browsing results
- File content preview with highlights
- Configurable file type filters
- Export/import index
