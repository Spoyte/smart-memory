## Project Built: QuickServe

**Time:** 5:31 AM (cron job execution)
**Project:** QuickServe — Instant HTTP server for file sharing

### What It Does
A zero-config file sharing server that:
- Serves any directory over HTTP with a single command
- Displays a QR code in the terminal for instant mobile access
- Supports drag-and-drop file uploads from phones/devices
- Has a beautiful dark-mode web interface
- Auto-shuts down after inactivity (optional)

### Why Built
- Filled a gap in the existing tool collection (no file sharing utility)
- Practical need: transferring files between computer and phone
- Wanted something better than `python -m http.server`

### Technical Details
- Pure Node.js (zero dependencies)
- Built-in HTTP server
- QR code generation via QRCode.js CDN
- GitHub-inspired dark UI
- Supports file upload via multipart form data

### Usage
```bash
node src/cli.js [path] [-p port] [-t timeout] [--no-upload]
```

### Location
`/root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/quickserve/`

## Project Built: API Workbench

**Time:** 6:08 AM (cron job execution)
**Project:** API Workbench — Terminal HTTP Client

### What It Does
A lightweight, zero-dependency HTTP client for API testing:
- Execute HTTP requests from the terminal
- JSON syntax highlighting for readable responses
- Request history with replay capability
- Collections to organize related requests
- Environment variables for different setups

### Why Built
- Filled a gap — no HTTP client existed in the toolkit
- Complements webhook-inspector nicely
- Useful for testing the betting tools' APIs
- Pure Node.js = instant startup, no dependencies

### Technical Details
- Pure Node.js (zero dependencies)
- Uses built-in `http`/`https` modules
- Stores data in `~/.api-workbench/`
- Color-coded output for methods and status codes

### Usage
```bash
apir GET https://api.example.com/users
apir POST https://api.example.com/users -d '{"name":"test"}'
apir GET https://api.example.com -H "Authorization: Bearer token"
apir env set API_URL https://api.example.com
```

### Location
`/root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/api-workbench/`
