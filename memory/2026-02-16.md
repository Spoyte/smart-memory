## Project Built: QuickServe

**Time:** 5:31 AM (cron job execution)
**Project:** QuickServe — Instant HTTP server for file sharing

### What It Does
A zero-config file sharing server that:
- Serves any directory over HTTP with a single command
- Displays a QR code in the terminal for instant mobile access
- Supports drag-and-drop file uploads from phones/devices
- Has a beautiful dark-mode web interface
- Auto-shuts down after inactivity (optional)

### Why Built
- Filled a gap in the existing tool collection (no file sharing utility)
- Practical need: transferring files between computer and phone
- Wanted something better than `python -m http.server`

### Technical Details
- Pure Node.js (zero dependencies)
- Built-in HTTP server
- QR code generation via QRCode.js CDN
- GitHub-inspired dark UI
- Supports file upload via multipart form data

### Usage
```bash
node src/cli.js [path] [-p port] [-t timeout] [--no-upload]
```

### Location
`/root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/quickserve/`
