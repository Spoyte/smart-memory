## Built: Local Search Engine

**Why this one:**
- Solves a real problem (finding files across projects)
- Builds on existing tools (file-organizer, smart-memory)
- Immediately useful for this workspace
- Right scope for a single-session build

**Features:**
- Full-text indexing of text files (code, docs, notes)
- Inverted index for fast queries
- TF-IDF scoring for relevance ranking
- Content previews with context
- Incremental updates (only changed files)
- File type filtering
- Zero dependencies (pure Node.js)

**Usage:**
```bash
local-search index .          # Index current directory
local-search search "query"   # Search files
local-search search "config" --ext js,json  # Filter by extension
local-search update           # Update changed files
local-search stats            # Show index statistics
```

**Technical Details:**
- Custom inverted index (word → documents mapping)
- Simple TF-IDF ranking
- JSON-based index storage
- Respects .gitignore and .searchignore
- Skips binary files automatically
